"Fatima and her husband where kind and helpful hosts. The house is in a quiet peaceful location. The room was cosy and I slept well there.  The communal areas need some love and attention and new photos on Airbnb to represent how the spaces are currently at this time.","Facilities"
"I stayed at Fatima's for 6 nights. Fatima is a kind person, and her place is peaceful. However, due to the number of guests in the house, the kitchen, bathroom, and toilet were not clean. Another issue was the coldness of the room at night. Since it was an attic room, it got very cold during the night, and there was really a need for a heater, which was not available. It was not even suggested. The attic ceiling was very close to the face and unfortunately it was, full of dried snot. It was really disgusting. But I emphasize that Fatima is considerate and kind person.","Facilities"

"Overall, I had a great stay. While I didn’t get to meet Fatima, her husband Tony was very accommodating. The location was handy, <5 mins walk to frequent bus services, proximity to a Tesco extra and the price for the location was more than fair. Generally the house was in a good state of cleanliness and the bathroom (shared with one other person) was cleaned once during my visit. The room was a reasonable size and the bed was comfortable. Overall I would really recommend staying here!","Facilities"
