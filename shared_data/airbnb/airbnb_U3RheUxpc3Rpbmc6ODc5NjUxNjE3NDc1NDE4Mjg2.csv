"Had a lovely stay. The room was as advertised. The only issue was that I was told I can have my room cleaned after 6 days of my stay. As I stayed for two weeks, I went to ask the reception to have my room cleaned twice. After both times, nobody cleaned it and by the end of my stay, the toilet and floor had become dirty."
"It was a good place to stay, very convenient location and decent room, would have been helpful if the place was cleaner and I was informed I could ask for a sheet change after 6 days untill it was too late. But overall a great place to stay in London."
"should be a tv, no plugs near the bed and the bed moves. other than that not a bad stay and nice and quiet"
"I was quite disappointed with my stay. Despite the reviews, I gave it a chance. The room was spacious, well-lit, and new, but I faced many issues. One night, the water stopped, and I needed to shower. They offered me to use the staff bathroom, which was filthy. This happened at 11 PM, and I had to wait a long time until they managed to turn the water back on, as I refused to shower in the dirty room they offered. There was no hot water throughout my stay, and I ended up taking cold showers for 7 nights. The bedlinen was dirty when I arrived, with insects and hair. To solve this situation the staff offering me sheets from another room that I had to get and change myself. The main light didn’t work, and despite reporting it daily, nothing was done. The building and location are good, but the staff is not equipped to handle guest requests."
"Excellent value for money. Matches photos. Well located. I recommend it. And for a future stay alone, I will come back here, simple and efficient."
"Clean"
"Excellent"
"Great place to stay. Got what you payed for"
"Good place to live for short stays. Next to cally park which is great."
"Good location and friendly staff, the bathroom could have been cleaner but the rest of the room was fine."
"It’s small but clean, really convenient and with fine price!"
"Great space for resting your head if you need to be in central London in the daytime. The bed was comfy and the room very clean. There wasn't much to do in the local area, but only a 5 minute walk to the local tube station."
"Great stay, thank you ava and team"
"Great place to stay. Clean, comfortable, plenty of storage and friendly, helpful staff. I loved staying there"
"Good location with tube just around the corner. Shower didn’t drain properly and the water for shower, sink and toilet randomly turned off for a few hours. Had no other issues. Staff were helpful. Overall a good place to stay"
"(+) Centrally located, multiple shops close by, easy check in and the possibility to leave your luggage at check out, comfortable beds and modern looking room. Responsive host.(-) A bit of a dusty room, multiple hairs on ‘clean’ towels. The constant banging of doors from other guests at crazy hours in the morning. Trash bags from other guests left behind in the kitchen for almost the whole duration of my stay (1 week)."
"Was really good"
"Excellent accommodation, very quiet, you have your space, private bathroom and a very comfortable bed to sleep. I would come back with great taste."
"I have been recently, is a space for students.For the price that I payed I couldn’t ask too much.Position is very good, metro is just 5 min by walk and with one stop you’ll be to king cross.Room is comfortable, if you don’t want too much and pay less is the perfect place here."
"I really enjoyed my stay there. Excellent location and very friendly staff."
"Good place to stay"
"nice stay"
"Perfectly as described. Exactly what I needed. I needed to extend my stay and they were super accommodating."
"This is a great option for a no fuss stopover. 24hr security and clean apartments. Not brand new, but definitely do the job. Exactly how they are listed. Recommended!"
"Perfect budget option. No complains"
"I was worried when I saw the reviews that the shared facilities such as the kitchen were dirty, but it was so clean for 28 days, and all the spaces were so uncomfortable. There was a park outside the window, so the view was so pretty."
"good stay of a month"
"you have to care about cleaning.its realy dirty"
"The student residence felt very safe and there is a supermarket downstairs.The beds were comfortable and there was a lot of space for one personThe design of the door needs a lot of force to close the door, so there is a lot of noise from people coming and going, and the quality of sleep is not affected.The bathroom is private but the water is slow to go and there will be water immersion"
"Location  good, subway in walking distance. Unfortunately, the room is not quite clean. Lots of wear and tear, furniture older. The mattress was completely saggy, but was replaced after consultation at the reception."
"Good stay, amazing experience"
"It was perfect for my stay in London - affordable, accessible, and the staff were helpful."
"Communication with the team was nice"
"For a short period of time it was a great place and way cheaper than hotels and apartments in central London. Would definitely recommend"
"The team was always available for clarification both remotely and live in the facility lobby.Quiet and clean environment within walking distance of the subway."
"I had a lovely stay and the accomodation was exactly what I was looking for (budget, location and cleanliness). Thank you for hosting me!"
"Decent student accommodation and friendly staff!"
"Room was great, really good location, building in general was kinda rough around the edges but honestly you won't get much better value for money than this place"
"The room's comfortable for one person, I had to work during my stay and the desk and chair were perfect for it. As for the cleanliness of the room, I'd say it needs to be better. My toilet lid was broken and kept falling off and my shower would get flooded in less than 1 min. The toilet was very very uncomfortable, so it might be the thing that would make me thing twice before choosing this place again. The bed sheets had some hair on them, I just cleaned them myself to feel more at ease, but I'd say that also needs to be better. The staff was very friendly and always helped me with any doubts I had."
"Perfect for a simple, no frills stop over."
"Very well located cozy room. The staff was very friendly and helpful at all times and the room was very comfortable and clean. Great experience in London if you want to be close to the city"
"Great location, so easy to get into central London. Great staff and amenities"
"I enjoyed staying here, the bathroom for me had a bit of a funny smell I couldn’t put my finger on, all the other residents were quiet but the doors are really loud (both the ones that section off the halls and the ones to the rooms) so you can really hear when people are entering as it’s a domino effect of noise (plus I felt bad entering sometimes as I know it would’ve been loud for others) it was what you’d expect for student accommodation - there’s always something right? Fair and good price & location!!"
"The team was really professional and helpful every time. The room was pristine clean when I arrived. Very reasonable priced accomodation."
"The place was clean, but the hallway was a bit noisy. You could hear people coming and going (opening and closing doors) in the middle of the night and early in the morning. Some noise from the street."
"Perfect for a no frills stopover."
"bed was Not very comfortable, but Had a good stay"
"All in all, the accommodation was good and I got along great with the location!"
"Convenient and decently priced for a 3 night stay for Wireless Festival. Close to KGX and Finsbury Park"
"Gladly again!!! Everything was very good. However, it should be noted that you need your own cooking pots, dishes, cutlery and glasses for the kitchen. Otherwise: Highly recommend!"
"got what i paid for and expected. no issues. front desk was helpful. just needed a spot to rest and was not dissapointed with that."
"We booked for our daughter to stay and she loved every minute of the stay."
"Friendly staff and convenient location. Room is clean itself though shared kitchen isn't."
"Overall, the room wasn't bad. However, the room was a bit small and was not cleaned regularly."
"Thank you so much.It is a good place.Only the laundry is not good cause it needs to take time to download and register an account before washes the clothes and have 5 pounds per each add fund’s condition. And changing new app issue let me feel bad."
"This is a great place to stay, close to all the happening places in London and still affordable. It would be good if the common areas like kitchen and lobbies are cleaned more often. Considering that guests stay here for short duration and everyone is not equally responsible, the common areas tend to get dirty and unhygienic.Other than this, the staff is very friendly and supportive. Overall a great experience."
"Hi,Great location, nice building, modern, but if you’re over 30, maybe not the place you will feel comfortable in, okay deal"
"Was alright"
"Thank you so much‼️"
"Overall it was good value for the price. It offered a private bathroom, gym access, a laundry room, and easy access to the Piccadilly line. Would book again.Careful with circuit laundry machines though, the app is very buggy. Only put it enough money for one wash at a time. It will steal your balance"
"Thanks"
"Nice place for a short visit. Has the basics and a nice desk to do remote working. There’s room for improvement with the bed mattresses but all in all I really liked it. The area is very convenient as it’s around the corner from Caledonian Road tube station. And the staff were friendly too. Highly recommended!"
"It's a nice place, with suitable facilities and good value for money"
"Great stay."
"Basic accommodation, comfy bed and nice to have en-suite. Good value for money in London"
"The place is very loud when other guests close the door on the hallway, it's extremely annoying and the kitchen was super dirty due to some guest that had no manner and did not know how to live with other people. I made a complain about the kitchen and no one did anything. Other than this, it was fine and worth the price for just a short period of stay it is perfect."
"Thank you. Great staff, very helpful and the place feels safe, there is security staff. The location is beautiful with gardens and very well located but yet not in the buzzing center. It is easily accessible: there is a subway stop to King's Cross (you can get to pretty much anywhere) or if you feel up for it, a 30 min walk. The place is like the picture and the room was very clean, with all the basic amenities. Thanks to Chapter Islington, my stay in London was even better."
"The room itself was great, exactly as described. Staff at the reception were friendly and helpful. Unfortunately the kitchen in the flat was filthy - on check-in I was told they would send housekeeping up as it was very dirty. I was there Thurs-Sun and it got progressively worse, with actual rotting fruit on the side, piles of dishes with crusty food and dirty water in the sink, and the microwave was covered in splattered food. A shame because the location and room were great!"
"It was great experience. Room is clean, staff are nice. Very close to the station, it’s easy to go to the central. Strongly recommended."
"Very good! Staff all very nice & happy to help with anything. Would definitely recommend!"
"Convenient location to commute to central London. I had a few issues with the shower and toilet but this got sorted fairly quickly."
"It was an extremely good stay! Clean rooms in a hostel situated very conveniently close to the Tube. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it to others."
"everything is fine, thank you"
"As advertised - simple, clean room with decent bed and decent shower."
"I really enjoyed my stay at Chapter Islington. The location was very close to the Piccadilly line into the city which allowed me to get into work in very good time. It was easy to talk to the reception team who were very responsive and helpful throughout my stay."
"Very conveniently located! Staff were friendly. Facilities are well resourced (gym, study area, kitchens)."
"Room was as described, perfect for a short stay. Kitchen was unfortunately very messy with overflowing bins and flies."
"Thanks a lot for hosting me in islington! Really cozy atmosphere and great location"
"Perfect for anyone staying in the area, especially with access to a kitchen and gym onsite.Would definitely stay again."
"It was a great stay for a short week in London."
"Great accommodation, close to the station and several markets and coffee shops. Quiet street is beautiful."
"I had an excellent stay in Chapter Islington. The location was extremely convenient, with both a bus stop and an underground station close by, and the room itself was clean and modern."
"Perfect last-minute find when other accommodations fell through. Very responsive and professional team."
"I am very glad that I stayed in Ora, both the price, the room and the system were fine"
"A very nice place to stay and very helpful staffs to assist"
"Never again… surrounded by noisy inconsiderate students. Walls as thick as curtains. Room allocated on ground floor next to a fire door that slammed day and night. Kitchen sink filled with dirty dishes that were there on 26th July and still there when I checked out early on 1st August. No crockery or cutlery available for first 3 days of my stay and found some washed next to the sink on day 4. Best thing was that it was close to Caledonian Rd Piccadilly Line Tube station and there are green spaces nearby."
"Easy to check in, safe, great location, safe friendly greeted with smiles, perfect for a short stay. Thank you"
"Its a very good place, I was lucky enough to hook especially that its difficult to find an ensuite for short term tenancy in london. The atmosphere of the accommodation was very safe and secure. Staff are friendly, reception open 24/7. However my only comment is the lack of bins in the room and the bathroom, and a bit slow to respond through texting. Overall definitely would recommend"
"Clean and spacious!"
"Basic but clean, and quieter than I expected. Reception staff were friendly, although they were quite busy so some small requests were forgotten, but nothing that would be a deal breaker. I’d stay again."
"The location is so good and they were nice to me!"
"Good place and reachable to venues.  Good communication and support. Non student visitors needs to think."
"Extremely responsive to guests’ needs and allowed an early check in because my plane arrived early. Easy to find, good amenities, even a gym to use! You have your own privacy and ensuite, however, the only issue I had was facing the courtyard as you tend to hear and likely receive less privacy due to the proximity. I switched rooms to alter the noise level etc. and the team were absolutely amazing at finding a solution. Right next to the Caledonian Road, underground, and plenty of buses. Definitely worth the price that you pay, I 100% will consider staying again the next time I’m in London☺️."
"Lovely Stay at Chapter Islington, very quite during the summer as most students have gone home. Great amenities and lots of shops nearby (Tesco, Sainsbury, Nisa Local) all in a short walking distance. Kitchen was fully equipped which was great as well."
"Would stay again"
"The place was good, clean and easily accessible..But the team was very slow to respondAnother problem was with the water in the bathroom.. the water pressures was too slow and the shower was too smallIf that can be overlooked, it is a great place for a short stay as the public transport is very convenient"
"The room was simple and great for what I needed with good location and nice welcoming staff. The downfall was the shared kitchen space, although modern with clearly new equipment, the other guests did not clean up after themselves. This left the place dirty and hard for me to use. I confronted friendly staff multiple times about having only the bin changed, in over week it never got changed and I got sick of asking."
"Very lovely staff. Friendly warm place to stay. Anytime again. Easy to get around."
"The host confirmed the whole property was smoke free. They stated, in writing, both public and private areas were no smoking and I could be reassured of a smoke free stay. That wasn’t the case, with people smoking on the property and outside my room, including none night at 2.30, smoking cannabis. The entire building is excessively hot. The team acknowledged there was an issue with the heat but said there was nothing they could do other than provide a fan (to circulate the hot air). The shower in the first room didn’t work. 80% of the water drizzled out of a leaking pipe, and it was one temperature-very hot. It couldn’t be turned down. I was moved to another room, which was cooler as it had two windows but, the first night someone was hammering on the wall for ages. Security were called and could hear the noise but couldn’t find which room. Second night the ground floor tenants were yelling in the early hours. On two days I couldn’t shower as the tray was blocked with water. Avoid"
"It was a very good stay thank you so much"
"Nice room a little less. Already dirty when I arrived and there was a bad smell"
"Best room for those looking for something low cost. perfect location right next to the caledonian road metro. I will definitely stay again."
"It was very central, theres a station on maybe 5 min walking distance, theres buses that get u everywhere and theres a supermarket along with starbucks! V nice located"
"The stay was overall decent. The location is in a quiet neighbourhood which wasn't very exciting, but it is close to one of the tube lines which is good. The cleanliness was decent although there were some stains on my bedding. The biggest issue was that there was no communication whatsoever from the hosts. Literally ignored and sent automated messages from the account. Luckily the reception at the building is really kind and were helpful in helping me find a solution."
"I was really pleased with the rented room. The cooperation with the receptionist team was perfect; they were friendly, smiling, and helpful. I had no problems during my stay; the room was clean, tidy, and had a functional bathroom. Another big advantage of the property is its location and excellent transport connections. Highly recommended!!! PJ"
"Lovely place to stay. As described in the listing. Would stay again."
"The toilet was not working. Internet service was limited."
"They are extremely professional and beautiful people. Very satisfied"
"the location was convenient as a tourist just 3min walk to the caledonian road train station.however, the only negative but significant problem was the network in the room also no table or pedestal fan was available in the room due to hot summer."
"Great accommodation for solo travellers, close to stations, easy to commute into London. Has everything that you need, would stay again."
"matches thr description"
"Was able to check in later at night, which was really great. The bed was pretty comfy and I liked the onsite gym quite a bit. Enjoyed my stay!"
"This is an friendly neighbourhood for uni student, which only one station away for King’s Cross. The shared kitchen is in very good condition and the room is very big for single tourists. Several supermarkets nearby to get food and only 5 mins walk to the underground."
"All in all it was a good stay in a student dorm. It felt safe and it’s easily accessible. My only remarks would be regarding the dated bathroom (despite it being clean it looked a bit rough) and the shower drain that didn’t work well. Despite the info that toiletries are included I was told at reception when asking for toilet paper that it isn’t included which I thought was odd. Maybe this needs to be updated in the description.When I reported the strong smell of weed on my hall throughout my stay the receptionist just told me that I should have reported it to security. Since there are so many employees working there, securities, housekeeping, I thought they would also have an eye on housing rules. Apparently was wrong.If you’re on a budget, yet want to have some privacy, this is still a good accommodation."
"It was a nice place and friendly people"
"I was surprised at the value for money of this location. My room was private and quiet with its own bathroom, and shared kitchen.  Everything was clean and basic - just what I needed in this trip. The building has excellent facilities (including a gym and laundry), and is run on an industrial scale. Initial communication was frustrating (especially with the glitchy booking confirmation system that asks you to upload your ID, which I had to repeat three times!), but that’s a small price to pay for an excellent location at a very reasonable rate per night. Will definitely consider staying here again."
"The room was exactly as I expected. Clean and tidy with lots of privacy. Very quiet and secure"
"Was money well spent. Did not over promise. You get real good value for your money."
"Everything was very good, I already knew the area and the stay was pleasant."
"A wonderful place to stay in London!"
"Thanks for the comfortable stay"
"Great location, staff was friendly and helpful."
"It was a great place with good facilities. My friends and I were really comfortable at the place"
"The place was nice but the bathroom needs some updating as well as the door to the main building. Please try and get that squeak fixed!! Otherwise I had a good stay the room was cozy and the kitchen was really cool and spacious it just needs some more bowls or something like this to eat. I would stay again though the staff was really nice and helpful."
"Good Accommodation and comfortable stay in a great location with easy access to the underground."
"Hi Liked everything about the stay. Only feed back would be the check out time.. I expected it to by 12 noon but was asked to vacate at 10am."
"Good spot to stay when just arriving from overseas. Friendly staff and secure building facilities. Room was fine and kitchen was clean an tidy."
"Will definately be back!"
