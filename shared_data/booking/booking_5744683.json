The location is great, super modern, clean and confortable, quiet and unpretentious.\nLet me address upfront the few negatives of this stay:\n\t- The pool water was not perfectly clean and there was also some dirt on the surrounded floor. I don't mind the children classes in the restricted schedule since the reception staff kindly informed us soo. Nevertheless the pool didn't felt cleaned for a hotel of this class. It should be a open shower directly near the pool and the staff should inform people to take a shower before entering the pool (no one did).\n\t- The recpetion lobby feels somewhat small and mainly executive style.. they could have done so much more here.. maybe more suitable for the residences entrance than the proper hotel.\n\t- Didn't like the reception desk so close to the near guest... it felt wrong. They should be more separated instead of the huge fake plants crowding the reception desks... the complimentary small cake was not good also. Overall not a good check in and first impression.\n\t- The extra charge prices at breakfast. For the price tag at least toast and different eggs styles should be included.\nThe remaining aspects of this stay were very good indeed. I really appreciated:\n\t- The huge bathroom. Modern, beautiful and functional. Clean aesthethic and amazing Diptyque bath products! Very nice indeed. I wish there was a bathtub though. In the first day a slight sewer smell appeared after using the shower but didn't felt any other time.\n\t- The size, design and confort of the room. Nice appointed mechanical curtains, very unique design, great furniture materials and perfect condition. Didn't like the carpet as some fibers come out easily. Bed really good indeed. Overall a very pleasant room.\n\t- Room cleaning was very good.\n\t- The hotel location was a big plus.\n\t- The hotel was quiet and relaxed at all times.\n\nSo would I return there? Definitely!",

I really appreciate your honest feedback as this allows us to look into the areas that have fallen short and make improvement to ensure similar issue do not happen to your future stay and other guests. \nAs for Reception, we have taken your feedbacks fully on board, we will take these into consideration when reviewing the hotel renovation in the future. At the same time, I would like to confirm that all plants and flowers in our hotel are fresh, they are looked after by a professional gardening company. I would take your comment of &quot;fake plants&quot; as a compliment as this means the potted plants must have looked in great condition so that they almost looked unreal. \nRegarding the complimentary cake, please accept my most sincere apology. From our tracked record, I could not locate that we have sent a cake to your room, therefore I would be the most grateful to know which cake we have sent so that I may investigate further. \n\nDear Nuno, once again, I would like to thank you for choosing to stay at Pan Pacific London.

In regards to the socket, as we need to comply with UK law, it is permitted to install electric sockets in the bathroom, except for electric shaver.

They also pre charge a £100 deposit per night, which is very excessive and unnecessary. The Porter then brought us up to the room and although he was very nice, he was really unable to read that we were tired and just wanted to head straight to bed - he overstayed his welcome to be honest.\nThe spa is lovely, but the heated pool is freezing and the sauna and steam rooms are cold.\nAnother odd experience was a woman letting herself into our room without knocking. She seemed shocked we were there and quickly left the room. I wasn’t decent and the encounter seemed very unofficial as the room had already been turned down. We were left feeling spooked out to be honest, what reason would she have to just walk in to the room without ringing the bell.\nLastly, the food in the Straight’s Kitchen was so bad that we didn’t eat it and left.",

We ordered room service a couple of times and found the food to be sub par and often incorrect. For instance, I ordered a 3 egg omelette for breakfast and was sent an omelette made of egg whites only which did not taste nearly as good as it would have if the yolks had been included. We ordered fries on another occasion, and the bowls / portions were absolutely tiny, especially for the high price. We also ordered food to the pool, and I ordered a set menu item of scrambled eggs on toast with smoked salmon. The meal arrived with no salmon included, and the eggs had not been seasoned at all and tasted very bland.

The view from the 16th floor was incredible, and the room was beautiful, spacious and had everything we needed - the mini bar offerings were especially great. The Diptyque toiletries were a real treat also! We loved the pool, though we felt it was a little cold in temperature, and the 'no kids' hours were not strictly in place - we headed down at one point during the 'no kids' hours to find multiple kids splashing and shouting and disturbing the ambiance. I loved the drawing room where I was able to do some work in peace, though as I was the only one in there I was surprised no staff came to offer me a menu or ask me if I needed anything - I would have ordered some coffee and maybe a snack whilst I worked. The staff at the door of the hotel who would greet us every morning were especially friendly and kind. Ginger Lily bar was wonderful, we got some tasty cocktails and finger food there.",

We asked for a fried egg from the lady who cooks them, to be told that she would bring it over, it never arrived, not surprising when she appeared to be on her phone, no toast. \r\nTrivial but - The chairs really drag across the floor and they are very noisy and close together and no plate warmer to heat plates.\r\nI would say the service and experience at breakfast is what has let our experience down. I had expected to pay this amount for breakfast but it's an insult when you get slapped with a service charge for no real service.\r\nI didn't see any instructions on how to use the digital lockers in the pool changing area - a note inside the locker would have been useful along with a changing room (I didn't see one) - I know that my mum wouldn't have been comfortable to change infornt of other people.",

Smilet at dinner front desk who took great care of my elderly mother who has limited mobility and ilias, the lead waitor at dinner.\r\nRoom: spacious, quiet, with great city views. The bed was huge, comfortable  and there were excellent amenities.\r\nBreakfast: excellent hot and cold selection at buffet, and a chef onsite for custom egg dishes.  Very good quality fresh and tasty food also the best pandan kaya I've had in the UK outside of my visits to Malaysia and Singapore.\r\nDinner: compliments to the dessert chefs from my family\r\nIn room dining (IRD): fantastic, managed to get a tasty  fresh meal at 4am and it arrived quickly too.\r\nFacilities: Spa, Sauna, infinity pool and had a really good pain-relieving massage treatment and rest in the relaxation room. Front desk manager was very accommodating of my changing birthday schedule.\r\nHotel Building: new, modern, luxurious but modest.\r\nThe Pan Pacific I've stayed in at Singapore was very flashy and huge. This one is a great compliment to it.\r\nLastly:  very happy a friend recommended it, I'd say the same to anyone planning to stay here.

We had a nice city view and the customer service is what really made this experience. Perhaps this is because they have only been opened for 2 months, I really hope they continue at this level.\n\nEverything felt modern and state of the art, with Dyson hairdryers, modern gym facilities and decent pool length (with a nice view). We have previously stayed with them in the flagship Singapore branch but the overall stay felt like a 4 star hotel (some feel like 5 star) and facilities were dated.\n\nAs for food, I tried to order the Hainanese chicken rice for dinner but due to a quality issue the head chef refused to serve it. Instead I opted for the lamb, it was the nicest lamb I have ever tasted (and I often order room service) with a good portion, tasty flavours and fluffy couscous. The in-room dining manager Cosmin gave a complimentary desert to make up for the lost time and I had the dark chocolate mousse (apparently exclusively curated by Cherish Finden) which, was a nice finish to my meal.\n\nConsequentially, I ordered a pizza and fries for a midnight snack. For breakfast we had a full English breakfast and the Asian breakfast (Gaya toast and wonton noodle soup) but all were lacking and not worth the price tag. I wonder if this is due to the time when the head chef was not around (dinner time).\n\nFinally, we finished off the stay with the afternoon tea and this was a pleasant experience. The dim sum was a bit so so, interesting take and catchy to the eye but you will find better flavours in most China Town dim sum restaurants. The experience and dishes progressively got better, finishing with the signature plate of sweets and the flavours were incredible, with a really refined palate. The lychee desert for me was the winner.\n\nEven though we only stayed for a weekend due to a meeting in the city, I would definitely recommend it if you need to stay in the area."

I know, I could have asked for it but didn’t, so as just to see what they might do. The blend of the breakfast tea however was very good indeed … 3) It would also be nice to have the breakfast-included bits of the menu - in my case poached egg on toast - be displayed a little less ‘coldly & basic’, e.g. maybe a little decoration like dried parsley sprinkled over the plate, etc.",

The room was huge and had everything you needed for a relaxing break. We stayed in a deluxe room with x2 double beds, they were huge and super comfy! the bathroom was so beautiful. The shower could fit in about 10 people. It was especially touching receiving a call at the door with a hand written note and luxury chocolates to wish myself a happy birthday. We loved the free use of the well-being floor. The pool is huge and the views are amazing, you feel so relaxed looking out at passes by as you relax in the calm surroundings.
