Staff at front desk could suggest nothing more than a Pure Gym an unspecified walk away, and no details, not even where to find it.

All they are doing is passing the task to the customer and this is simply cost saving (in a setting where the stay is very expensive). House keeping services in cheaper hotel lines is much better than what’s provided here.\n\nAs a side note, rooms were noisy (poor sound insulation from the corridor and fellow rooms), the television had only two channels working (BBC1 and 2) and could not connect to the internet/was not fully SMART enabled (meaning no Netflix, Amazon prime etc) the grouting in the shower kept flaking off when it was being used.",

When we came for our table booked for 8pm, we arrived at 8:05pm, the hostess told us that we were late and therefore wouldnt have a table for us for an hour or more but we could sit at the bar. I explained we had booked this table 2 months in advance and that we had arrived within the grace period. She was extremely rude to her colleague who tried her best to adjust tables to make space for her and batted off her idea's by saying 'please ignore her she is new' which we could visibly see was upsetting for the waitress. \r\nEventually 'it was a miracle' that they were able to find us a table tucked next to the hostess stand where they kept knives and forks etc. We felt completely disregarded and it unfortunately set the tone for the whole dinner which we had looked forward to so much. We could see tables by the windows were empty for reservations... though we had reserved so far in advanced this wasnt offered to us. \r\nThe food was amazing but our drinks didnt arrive until we ordered the bill. \r\nOverall, really disappointed with our stay and dinner experience which is such a shame as we were so excited for our London getaway that I had organised as a surprise, especially as we had read such great things.",

The hotel's design was modern, chic, and full of character, with unique touches that made it stand out from other hotels. Every corner of the hotel was beautifully curated, creating a stylish and inviting ambiance.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of my stay was the exceptional staff. The team at The Hoxton went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was memorable. As a special surprise for my boyfriends birthday, they left a thoughtful gift in our room, which made us feel incredibly valued and appreciated as a guest.\n\nThe hotel's bar downstairs was a trendy and vibrant space, perfect for enjoying cocktails and mingling with other guests. The restaurant on the first and top floor was simply outstanding, offering a diverse menu with delicious dishes that satisfied my culinary cravings. The attention to detail and quality of food and drinks was top-notch.\n\nIn conclusion, the hotel exceeded all our expectations. I highly recommend The Hoxton to anyone seeking a remarkable stay in London Southwark, and I look forward to returning in the future.\n\nSee you soon again!",

The design of the hotel is also very nice...contemporary rustic but very comfortable too. We stayed in a 'cosy' room category which was a reasonable size with a lovely bathroom featuring a superb rain shower. We were facing the main road but didn't experience any issues with traffic noise at all. The hotel is very well located for the Tate Modern and it's only a short walk along the river to the the South Bank area. We booked the Seabird Restaurant on the first night...an amazing rooftop venue on top of the hotel which would be fantastic in the summer although there were plenty of heaters if you wanted to sit outside and brave the early spring weather. We were seated near the kitchen service area at first which was a little too noisy and brightly lit for us. After requesting to move, we had a much nicer seat with stunning views across the city. The fish was amazing and the service was very friendly and attentive. Will definitely head back to The Hoxton on our next visit to London.",

Even ordering the right cab was difficult as well as booking a table for breakfast. Really had the impression the staff was willing but too inexperienced to handle the issues. Finally I really did not appreciate the fact that I always had to ask to clean up the room (so called green policy : ok but turn it around : do cleanup except if agreed not to do so).  In short : great location, nice venue but the failing processes would make me choose for another hotel.",

Meanwhile she was just chatting and laughing with a male colleague. She said she was going to try again and within seconds, she assured us that she found one. She asked us to go wait outside that the taxi will be arriving in 8 mins. \n\nWe stood outside waiting in the cold for 9 mins, and I called the receptionist again, she picked up the phone as said the taxi will take another 7 mins, and asked me if I needed her to book another one. \n\nI asked her “are you sure you actually booked a taxi, we have somewhere important to be”. She reassured me that the taxi was booked and was on his way. She even asked if I was calling with my number so she can call when the taxi arrived. We waited and waited in the cold and got no call or taxi. \n\nWe were super late and I eventually found an Uber nearby. Our mood was ruined before we even got there and we had to leave within mins. Seeing how our important night was ruined, we had to cancelled the rest of the plans for the trip, including the seabird on Sunday, which I was charged £40 for cancelling. \n\nThis extremely disappointing to say the least and one experience I will never forget. I felt neglected and ignored! As a woman a colour, sadly, this is something we had to deal it. We had traveled all the way from Devon. I would have preferred that she declined my request for a taxi, so I could find one by myself. \n\nWe met her on Monday morning (25th) while checking out and she met us with a frown, no apologies, nothing, acted like she forgot what she did !!!",

There is no gym in the hotel but they do have a gym that they partner with except we were charged 10pound a day to use it. Again, something that should have been included for the price of the room. \r\nNo daily housekeeping - you have to ask for it at reception.

There was a lovely welcome letter for us upon entry to our room. Room service food was so nice and was very quick too. We were greeted politely everytime we entered and left the hotel. We had a late flight when leaving so asked if there was any option of late check out. Reception gave us a 4pm late check out with no extra charge. Cant say enough about the staff.

The bed was extremely comfortable with a really squishy duvet. \nIt was my partner's birthday so they had even left a thoughtful note and some sweets for him in the room.\nThe hotel is brilliantly located to explore Southbank, Westminster, Covent Garden and beyond. There are lots of attractions within 10-15 minutes' walk, for example the BFI, the National Theatre, London Dungeons... we went to the BFI Odeon iMax to see a film. \nAfter strolling along the river we wandered back to the hotel and sat in some very comfy armchairs in The Albie. We had a few drinks and a bite to eat. It was all delicious. The cocktails are quite pricy but beers and so on were standard London pricing. The bar area is very tastefully done and has a relaxed atmosphere. We could have spent longer but we had to get ready to meet some friends.\nWe got back too late unfortunately to sample the desserts or cocktails up in the Seabird. (The kitchen closed at 10.30 and the bar closed at 11.30). But they did let us pop up to relax on the beautiful terrace/balcony and admire the views of London at night. The music was fun, there were heaters to stop you getting too chilly in the breeze and it felt like being on holiday. \n(FYI the reception have a mini bar if you fancy a night cap but the choice is a bit limited).\nWe both slept so well and would happily have stayed in bed hours longer were it not for commitments. We had arranged to have brunch elsewhere so we didn't sample breakfast in the hotel.\nAll in all a lovely stay and we both want to come back!"
